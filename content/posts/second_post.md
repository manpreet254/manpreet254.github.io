# ❤️ The Marvel of the Human Heart

![Human Heart](/second_post/heart.jpg)

The human heart is a **powerful muscular organ** about the size of your fist, yet it performs one of the most critical tasks in your body — **pumping blood**. Located slightly left of the center in your chest, the heart beats about **100,000 times per day**, delivering oxygen and nutrients to every cell. 🩸

## 🫀 Anatomy of the Heart

The heart is made up of **four chambers**:

- **Right Atrium** and **Right Ventricle**: Receive deoxygenated blood from the body and pump it to the lungs.
- **Left Atrium** and **Left Ventricle**: Receive oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pump it to the rest of the body.

### The Valves of the Heart

Valves act like gates that keep blood flowing in the right direction:

- **Tricuspid valve**
- **Pulmonary valve**
- **Mitral valve**
- **Aortic valve**

These valves open and close with each heartbeat. 🔄

## ❤️ Fascinating Facts

- Your heart pumps around **1.5 gallons of blood per minute**.
- Over a lifetime, it may beat **over 3 billion times**. 🔁
